## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when a teacher is eligible for your service if they completed
their initial teacher training before or after a specific date.

## When not to use this pattern

Do not use this pattern when you need to ask the exact date a  teacher completed
their initial teacher training.

## How it works

When asking when the teacher completed their initial teacher training:

- do not use the initialism ITT (initial teacher training) which is common
within DfE
- use radios to list the options
- describe in academic years rather than specific dates

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "when-did-you-complete-ITT", example: "error-none-selected", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### If the user does not select an academic year

Say ‘Select when you completed your initial teacher training’.

## Research on this pattern

Whilst developing this pattern we looked into:

- how to best ask this question using specific dates or academic years –
  academic years make more sense to teachers
- how best to describe a trainee teacher’s route into teaching – there are many
  different routes but 'Initial teacher training' is a blanket term that
  teachers are familiar with and understand
