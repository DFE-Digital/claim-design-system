## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you need to ask a user how much they repaid towards their student loan in a given timeframe.

## How it works

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "student-loan-amount", example: "error-empty-field", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in the GDS
[error message component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)
and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If nothing has been entered

Say 'Enter your student loan repayment amount'.

#### If the incorrect amount of characters have been entered

Say 'Value must be less than 99999'.

## Research on this pattern

This pattern is based on the proposed [Currency input](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/68)
in the design system community backlog.
