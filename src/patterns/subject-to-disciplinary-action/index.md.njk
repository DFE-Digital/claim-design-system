{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "subject-to-disciplinary-action", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you need to ask a teacher if they are currently subject to
disciplinary action.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "subject-to-disciplinary-action", example: "error-none-selected", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### If nothing has been selected

Say ‘Select yes if you are subject to disciplinary action’.

Make sure errors follow the guidance in the GDS
[error message component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)
and have specific error messages for specific error states.

## Provide more information on the ineligible screen

It's possible that a user's disciplinary action will be revoked before the
deadline for a service. You should tell users this deadline if your service is
not open all year round.

## Say that we only use this for eligibility

Users may be concerned that we'll store this information or use it against them in some way.

## Research on this component

Some users struggled with this question indicating that there could be an initial
informal investigation before formal disciplinary action was taken.

Users were also worried that they would be added to a list that would be used
for other purposes. When asking this question we recommend that you clearly
state how this information will be used.
