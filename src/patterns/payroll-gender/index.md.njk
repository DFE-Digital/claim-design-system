## When to use this pattern

Avoid asking users for gender and always follow the
[guidelines on the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/gender-or-sex/).

Use this pattern when you need to provide a gender for a user to an external
system, where that gender is constrained to a binary response. For example, if
HMRC require a 'female' or 'male' value to identify an individual for payroll.

This is a very specific scenario, however the research and design decisions that
went into creating this pattern may be insightful for other teams.

## When not to use this pattern

Do not use this pattern to ask users how they identify their gender.

## How it works

In our example, we needed to provide HMRC with a value for gender.

HMRC currently only recognise Male and Female genders as a method of identifying
a user's tax accounts (along with other identifiers).

Gender is a required field.

We designed this pattern to avoid asking the user for their gender when we only
needed to know what HMRC were most likely to have recorded, in order to match a
user to that record.

To remain sympathetic to users, and transparent about why we're asking for this
information:

- tell users exactly what information you're asking for
- explain why you're asking for this information
- let users know what you'll do with their data
- provide an option for those who do not know (this is different to providing an
"I prefer not to say" option)
- let users know what you'll do if they cannot provide this information
- do not store this information if you do not need to do so

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "payroll-gender", example: "error-none-selected", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in the GDS
[error message component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)
and have specific error messages for specific error states.

### There are concerns for users

A user's gender can change. Asking users about their gender can force them to reconsider which gender they
associate with at that time and potentially cause some distress or anxiety.

Recording information about a user's gender can also have a detrimental impact on
them now or in the future.

The information might be stored in a way that is difficult to change, or it may
be shared or used for a different purpose.

Users may also have concerns that their response will be used as evidence of how
they identify their gender.

It's important to make it clear why we're asking and give users the choice not
to respond. If users choose not to respond, you must have a mechanism for
finding out and you must never guess.

Consider who within your service needs to access this information and only
share it when absolutely necessary.


## Research on this pattern

This pattern has had limited research with LGBTQIA+ groups. More research is
required to understand:

- how comfortable users are with DfE handling this data
- if it's clear to users why we ask for this information and if they understand
- if users know what's on record at HMRC or at their school
- if we're creating discomfort for users who have to ask the question to someone
at their school
- if the question is difficult to answer correctly for users who have thought
about their gender differently at different times
