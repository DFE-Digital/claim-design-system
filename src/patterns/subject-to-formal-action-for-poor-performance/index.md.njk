## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you need to ask a teacher if they are currently subject to
formal action for poor performance at work.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "subject-to-formal-action-for-poor-performance", example: "error-none-selected", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### If the user does not make a selection

Say ‘Select yes if you are subject to formal action for poor performance at work’.

## Provide more information on the ineligible screen

It's possible that users' disciplinary action will be revoked before the deadline
for a service. You should tell users this deadline if your service is not open
all year round.

## Say that we only use this for eligibility
