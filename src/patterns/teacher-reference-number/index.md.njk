{% from "_example.njk" import example %}

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "teacher-reference-number", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you need to collect the teacher reference number from
users. Not everyone knows their teacher reference number, and whilst it is
possible to find out a teacher reference number, it can be a costly question to
answer.

## How it works

### Allow different formats
Users should be allowed to enter teacher reference numbers in whatever format is familiar to them. You should allow for additional spaces and slashes.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "teacher-reference-number", example: "error-empty-field", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in the GDS
[error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)
and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If nothing has been entered

Say ‘Enter your teacher reference number’.

#### If the incorrect amount of characters have been entered

Say ‘Teacher reference number must contain seven digits’.

### Using example telephone numbers
If you wish to include an example teacher reference number (in hint text for example):

- If your number is "9912345" just enter "9912345"
- If your number is "RP 99/54321" just enter "9954321"
- If your number is "68/45678" just enter "6745678"

### Avoid input masking

Avoid [input masking](https://css-tricks.com/input-masking/) because it makes it harder for users to:

- type a number in their preferred way
- transcribe a number from another place and check that they’ve got it right
