## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to help a user identify a school somewhere in England.

## How it works

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xnk4J9WhmB8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Schools in England are maintained on the [Get information about schools](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/)
(GIAS) service. We use this data to make it easier for the user to find a school.

When asking for a school

- give multiple methods of finding a school
- use [accessible autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete)
to help a user when typing long school names
- use up to date data from Get information about schools
- display additional information to the user to help them identify the correct
school (such as the address)
- support those who do not have JavaScript enabled
- depending on what your service needs to do, distinguish between open and
closed schools
- do not use an autocomplete attribute

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "school-search", example: "error-empty-field", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in the GDS
[error message component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)
and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If the input is empty

Say ‘Enter the name or postcode of the school’.

#### If no results match the search term

Say ‘No results match that search term. Try again.’

### Non-javascript version

Accessible autocomplete is a progressive enchancement, you will need to create
a non-javascript version of your search. This should include all the same
features and information.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "school-search", example: "with-search-results", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

## Research on this pattern

Research on this pattern is limited. We've done some testing which indicates it
is usable and accessible, but we've also included an option for users who are
unable to use JavaScript.


### Employed to teach vs employed at

Most schools are part of a Multi Academy Trust (MAT) and teachers may not be employed by
the school they work at. For example, a teacher's employment contract could be
with the MAT, but they work at an academy within the MAT.

You can distinguish between asking where a teacher is employed and where they
work by using 'employed to teach at'.

### Open and closed schools

Some schools close then reopen with a new name, a slightly different name, or
the same name. In these cases GIAS will return more than one school. Only
display to the user the open school and discount the closed schools. If you need
to show a user closed schools:

- visually differentiate them to make it easier to pick
- display to the user when the school closed

### Problems finding the right school

Some school names are more difficult to search for and identify.

Some schools are hard to distinguish between due to having similar names, for
example if there are multiple 'St Andrew's'.

A teacher may also type the school name differently to how it is spelt in the
GIAS data, for example typing 'Saint' instead of 'St' or using an apostrophe
differently.

For circumstances such as these, provide alternative methods of searching such
as by address or postcode as well as name.

You might also consider ignoring apostrophes and other punctuation in the
search.
